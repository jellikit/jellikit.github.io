	<h1>Primus visits Waite Park, MN, chaos ensues</h1>
	<h2>Opening Band</h2>
	<p>Tonight, on July 26th, 2024, Primus put on an absolutely phenomenal performance at the Ledge Amphitheater. However, first I would like to shine some light on the opening band, <b>Too Many Zooz</b>. I didn’t know what to expect from them, but I was able to hear them testing their instruments all the way from the venue interest and I was <em>pleasantly surprised</em>. They are a very high energy three piece band, including a saxophone, trumpet, and percussion. They played a whole bunch of original music, as well as a few covers of popular songs such as Get Busy by Sean Paul and Hash Pipe by Weezer. Impressively, the saxophone player danced all over the stage while steadily playing his instrument during the entire set!</p>
<h2>Coheed & Cambria</h2>
<p>Of course, we can’t forget the band Primus is touring with. Coheed & Cambria is painfully underrated, and so are their live performances. The best part, obviously, is watching Claudio’s absolutely glorious hair as he sings and plays guitar. The graphics that played behind the stage as they played music were almost hypnotizing, adding to the already incredible experience.</p>
<h2>Primus</h2>
<p>I, the author, would like to preface this by saying I am a huge fan of Les Claypool and all his music. I have over 13,000 listens on Spotify for Primus alone. Seeing them live was a dream come true. They started the night off by playing Those Damn Blue-Collared Tweakers, and continued to play a setlist which comprised of songs from Frizzle Fry all the way to the Conspiranoia EP. Les Claypool played the bass flawlessly, Ler’s guitar playing added to the perfection, and Herb’s drumming completed it. I seemed to not be the only one who had an amazing night, however. My mom who went with me also enjoyed herself.</p>
